Hi George,

Thanks for sending me your questions. 

To answer your first question, I always like to think about search from the perspective of a library. The books are the records and the bookcase is the index. The index is just the place where the records are stored, just like a bookcase! 

When you are creating your index for the first time, just ask yourself, "What books will I place into my bookcase that I would like my users to search?" Records are your books, and your index is the bookcase.

In keeping with our library example, let's say you would like to put the books on the shelves of your bookcase in order of the book's popularity. You could do this using a custom ranking. You can also use "date" as a Custom Ranking. Any metric that you would like to use to help sort the results of the search would be good candidates for the ranking.

I hope this helps George. If you have any more questions please don't hesitate to contact me directly.

Best Regards,
John

Hi Matt,

Sorry to hear about your frustration with the new interface. 

Just so we are on the same page, to clear or delete an index, you can simply login to your dashboard, click "indices" on the left-hand navigation menu, and then under "Manage Index" you should see Clear and Delete options.

If this is too many clicks, I can pass your feedback along to our development team and see if they can come up with a quicker solution that may serve you better in the future.

Again, I apologize for your frustration. Please let me know if this information helps, and if there is any other points of frustration you would like to address. We are always trying to improve, and your feedback is essential.

Regards,
John

Hi Leo,

I'll be glad to walk you through the process at a high level.

To get started, first you need to have a dataset that you wish to make searchable on your website. You can upload this dataset using the Algolia dashboard to create what is called an index.

Once you have your index, you can integrate into your website using an API Key and our [InstantSearch Components](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/) that we make available to all Algolia customers.

If you can copy and paste HTML into your webpage, and upload the files to your webserver, you can integrate with Algolia.

If you would like to schedule a call with me so that I cam explain the process in more detail, please don't hesitate to choose a time that works for you from [my calendar](https://fakelink.com).

Regards,
John
